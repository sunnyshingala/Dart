    - what are literals?
        //Literals
            true;
            2;
            "john";
            4.5;
    - various ways to write literals
    - string interpolation 

3.3 Constants using 'final' and 'const' keyword.
    - How to define Constants?
        = if you never want to change a value than use final and const keywords
             final keyword
                final name = "Peter";
             const keyword
                const pi = 3.14;

        * Difference between final and const
             final variable can only be set once and it is initialized when accessed.
                (if we does'nt use variables it will never consume memory)
             const variable is implicity final but it is a compile time Constants
                -i.e It is initialized during compilation
                (for const It means wather we use or not it will consume memory)
